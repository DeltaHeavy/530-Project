CSC 530 Project
===============

Max Zinkus for Dr. Clements' CSC 530 class, Grad Languages and Translators,
with a focus on fuzzing and testing.

This project is focused on evaluating C code coverage through simulated walks
of a CFG by instrumenting code to emit some sort of events as basic blocks are
traversed.
